# BhajpaTracker
Bharat mata ki Jai. Vande mataram, This is a toolkit to fight against Sanghis. Responsibility for any content added by any contributor lies with that particular contributor. Anti-National, Anti India and "calling/cheering for violence" content will not be tolerated. If by chance any of that content does end up here inspite of our best efforts to moderate, the person/organization committing the content is responsible.  


# Why Github
Any change can be tracked and traced to the contributor who made that change.

All changes need to approved for merge. So for example if a person adds anti national content, it won't be approved for merge into the master branch
